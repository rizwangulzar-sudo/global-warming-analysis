# 🌍 Global Warming Analysis

This project uses real-time climate data from NASA GISTEMP to analyze and visualize global temperature anomalies from the 1800s to the present.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 📊 Visualizations
- Line chart of annual temperature anomalies
- Heatmap of monthly anomalies across decades

## 📁 Dataset
